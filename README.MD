<h1>Hello, this is the employees accounting app</h1>
<p>

It was created to maintain information about the company's employees. 
<br> 
<br>The base contains information about 
<br><i>'first_name'</i> - employee name, 
<br><i>'last_name'</i> - employee surname,
<br><i>'role'</i> - what position does the person hold, 
<br><i>'description'</i> - a summary of the employee, 
<br><i>'start_work'</i> - when an employee started work, 
<br><i>'end_work'</i> - when an employee finished work, 
<br><i>'wage'</i> - how much does the employee earn
